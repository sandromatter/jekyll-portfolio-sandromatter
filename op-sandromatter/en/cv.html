          Nice to meet you!

        <p>
          I am a multi-talented person and have been working in various
          marketing agencies for almost five years, besides riding my mountain
          bike – my other major passion next to marketing and the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been employed in marketing agencies as a desktop publisher and
          online marketing specialist and also had the opportunity to gain experience
          as media designer, photographer and camera operator.
          My professional career started 9 years ago, when I begun my swiss apprenticeship as designer of digital and print
          media.

          Ever since I can remember, I have always been curious. In my opinion,
          constantly learning and experimenting is part of life just as much as
          it is part of business. I believe there is something new and exciting
          to discover and learn every day. I love to keep learning, continue to challenge myself and do
          interesting things that matter to me. My motto is: Try. Fail. Improve.
          Because making mistakes, improving constantly, and adapting is how you
          learn best. As a person, I am calm and stay focused even in
          stressful situations.

        <p>
          After my compulsory education, I completed an apprenticeship as a
          designer of digital and print media at ZT Medien AG, working with
          tools such as the Adobe suite in the prepress departement.
          Subsequently, I switched from the print departement to the digital
          agency of the media company, called #ztplus. In these two years, I planned
          and realized online marketing campaigns, assisted in film productions,
          implemented web projects, organized photo shootings and consulted for
          the introduction of a new editorial system. In 2019, I started a
          part-time bachelor programme “Digital Business Management” at the
          University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons, which I expect to
          complete in summer 2022. Besides, I work part-time as an online
          marketing specialist at the advertising agency Stutz Kommunikation and
          freelance at the agency ADi AG.
