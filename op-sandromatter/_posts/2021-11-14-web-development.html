    In my work life I had the opportunity to use various content management
    systems such as Wordpress, Contao or Drupal as editor. However, in my spare
    time I often experiment with new web frameworks and tools (such as GatsbyJS,
    Wordpress or Jekyll) as a developer and designer for the sake of learning,
    and mostly because I enjoy coding. I also successfully completed the almost
    30-hour LinkedIn Learning Path "Junior Wordpress Developer", where I learned
    the basics of Wordpress from a developer point of view. A particular
    interest of mine during development, is clean code and accessibility - a
    topic I have written a number of papers about, in my studies.
