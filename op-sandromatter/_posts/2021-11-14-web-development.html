    In my job I had the opportunity to work with various content management
    systems such as Wordpress, Contao or Drupal as editor. However, in my spare
    time I am often trying new web frameworks and tools (such as GatsbyyJS,
    Wordpress or Jekyll) as a developer and designer for the sake of learning,
    and mostly because I enjoy coding. I also successfully completed the almost
    30-hour long LinkedIn Learning Path "Junior Wordpress Developer", where I
    learned the basics of Wordpress as a developer. A particular interest of
    mine when developing is clean code and accessibility - a topic I already
    wrote a number of papers about at university.
