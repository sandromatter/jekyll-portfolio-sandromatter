    Photo- and videography: Topics that always interested me a lot. I learnt the
    basics of photography in my apprenticeship as print and media designer and
    used the knowledge later in my career. I had the chance of taking photos of
    clients and for the newspaper "Zofinger Tagblatt". My photos got printed and
    published several times. During my time at the digital agency #ztplus
    organising photo shoots was also part of my job. Besides taking photos
    behind the photo camera, I was regularly behind the video camera for live tv
    recordings in the studio of the local media outlet.

    I always have my camera with me, especially when I travel. I love exploring
    cities with my camera and taking photos that have never been taken before or
    shared 100x on Instagram. My Fuji X100s from 2013 is still considered my
    best buy ever. The little cam has been everywhere with me: in Australia, New
    York, Paris and of course in the Swiss mountains. Can't wait to take it to
    Canada! There are missing a few pictures of it on my
