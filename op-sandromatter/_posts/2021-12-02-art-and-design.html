  <p>
    Pen and paper or even a brush have been used much less since I started
    working in marketing. However, the knowledge of design, composition or
    typography that I gained when I was a desktop publisher, often designing
    print and web projects, I can still use almost every day. Whether it is when
    creating mockups, in content creation or just in choosing a suitable font.
