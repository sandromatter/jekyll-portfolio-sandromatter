  <p>
    I have been working in marketing agencies for more than four years. At
    first, I was working as a desktop publisher, often doing creative work, such
    as layouting, designing and photography, until I started working
    increasingly in the digital field. Currently I am working part-time as an
    online marketing specialist besides studying for my bachelors degree, which
    I will finish next summer. Tools like Google Ads, Facebook Business and Ads
    Manager or Google Analytics and the Tag Manager are all part of my daily
    work in the agency "Stutz Kommunikation". There we assist SMEs to promote
    their businesses, guide them through the digital jungle and help them to win
    new customers.
