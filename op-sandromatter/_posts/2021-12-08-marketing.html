  <p>
    I have been working in marketing agencies for more than five years. At
    first, I was working as a desktop publisher, often doing creative work, such
    as layouting, designing and photography, until I started working
    increasingly in the digital field. In my most recent job I was working
    part-time as an online marketing specialist besides studying for my
    bachelors degree, which I graduated from in September 2022. Tools like
    Google Ads, Facebook Business and Ads Manager or Google Analytics and the
    Tag Manager were part of my daily work for a long time. Since spring 2023, I
    have been supporting our customers at Freundliche Gr√ºsse AG as a consultant.
