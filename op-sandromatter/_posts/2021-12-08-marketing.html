  <p>
    I have been working in marketing agencies for more than three years. At
    first, I was working as a desktop publisher, often doing creative work, such
    as layouting, designing and photography, until I started working
    increasingly in the digital field. At the moment I'm working part-time as an
    online marketing specialist besides studying for my bachelors degree, which
    I will finish next summer. I switched my job because the digital world was
    and still is exciting to me. I am very familiar with tools like Google Ads,
    Facebook Business and Ads Manager or Google Analytics and the Tag Manager -
    but still try to improve constantly. After all, there is something new to
    learn every day. In my daily business I work in the small agency "Stutz
    Kommunikation" where we assist SMEs to promote their businesses, guide them
    through the digital jungle and help them to win new customers.
