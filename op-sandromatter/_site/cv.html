          Nice to meet you!

        <h2>Short introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I am a multi-talented person and have been working in various
          marketing agencies for almost five years, besides riding my mountain
          bike – my other major passion next to marketing and the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been employed in marketing agencies as a desktop publisher and
          online marketing specialist and had the opportunity to gain experience
          in these areas, as well as designer, photographer and camera operator.
          I have been working in the professional world for 9 years since I
          started my swiss apprenticeship as designer of digital and print
          media, in a printing and media company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since I can remember, I have always been curious. In my opinion,
          constantly learning and experimenting is part of life just as much as
          it is part of business. I believe there is something new and exciting
          to discover and learn every day. Skills can be taught, personality is
          inherent. I love to keep learning, continue to challenge myself and do
          interesting things that matter to me. My credo is: Try. Fail. Improve.
          Because making mistakes, improving constantly and adapting is how you
          learn the best. As a person, I am calm and stay focused even in
          stressful situations.

        <h2>My background</h2>
        After my obligatory education, I completed an apprenticeship as a
        designer of digital and print media at ZT Medien AG, working with tools
        such as the Adobe suite in the prepress departement. Subsequently I
        switched from the print departement to the digital agency of the media
        company, #ztplus. In these two years, I planned and realized online
        marketing campaigns, assisted in film productions, implemented web
        projects, organized photo shootings and consulted for the introduction
        of a new editorial system. In 2019, I started a part-time bachelor
        programme “Digital Business Management” at the University of Applied
        Sciences of the Grisons, which I expect to complete in summer 2022.
        Besides, I work part-time as an online marketing specialist at the
        advertising agency Stutz Kommunikation and freelance at the agency ADi
        AG.
